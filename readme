Looking to use the Mavenlink API; http://developer.mavenlink.com/beta/


Fetching all projects
API - http://developer.mavenlink.com/beta/#tag/Workspaces%2Fpaths%2F~1workspaces%2Fget
Query params
 - archived ('exclude' to not have them returned and only current shown) --- This may be redundant looking at the `include_archived` param
 - for_approver (only returns project that are associated with the user, e.g. the person authorized)
 - per_page (default is 20)
 - search (test this to see if you can add in a string that matches the project!!!)

Fetching a list of participants for a specific project
API - http://developer.mavenlink.com/beta/#tag/Participations
Query params
 - workspace_id {required} (id of the project)

Getting a list of time entries
 API - http://developer.mavenlink.com/beta/#tag/Time-Entries
 Query params
  - created_after (datetime from)
  - created_before (datetime to)
  - with_user_ids (specify users)
  - workspace_id (a specific project)
